# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-C
This Tic Tac Toe game allows players to strategically place X's and O's on a 3x3 grid by inputting numerical characters from 1 to 9. The game leverages arrays, including character arrays for X and O, as well as 2D arrays to represent the grid. Players can make by entering the corresponding position on the grid. The project incorporates a play-again feature and fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, and file I/O, offering an excellent learning opportunity for beginners in game development.
